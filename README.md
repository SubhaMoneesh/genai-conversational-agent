# GenAI-Powered Conversational Agent with Agentic Capabilities

## Description
This project is an advanced conversational agent designed to provide insightful and context-aware responses by leveraging Large Language Models. It features an agentic framework that enables the model to perform autonomous actions and is equipped with an Explainable AI (XAI) component for transparency.

## Features
- **Conversational AI**: A sophisticated agent that understands natural language and maintains context throughout a conversation.
- **Agentic Capabilities**: The agent can use external tools, such as web search APIs, to find information and perform tasks.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: A component that provides insight into the agent's decision-making process.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **LangChain**
- **Streamlit**
- **PyTorch**
- **LIME/SHAP**
